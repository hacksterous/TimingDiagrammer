# TimingDiagrammer
## An application to draw timing diagrams for digital logic.

This is a successor to the [waves](https://github.com/hacksterous/waves) app that I wrote a long time ago.
It was simple, but lacked a few features like saving entire canvas (not just the viewport) as an image (which
seemed hard to implement in Tk. Also, waves had a few glaring omissions like not supporting the ':' in the 
signal name and ability to color data.

I have tried to fix these in Timing Diagrammer, which is written using PyQt5.
